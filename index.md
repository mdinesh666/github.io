Hello, I'm Muthudinesh.
I'm a Product Designer at Congruent. By day, I build robust enterprise applications. By night, I tinker with electronics and AI. I bridge the gap between "it looks good" and "it actually works."

### [GPS Navigation Device](./project-1)
**Oct 2025** A minimalist pure navigation device built for delivery partners using ESP32.

### [Email System Design](#)
**Sep 2025** Redesigning the HTML email template structure for better responsive behavior.
